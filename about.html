      (FLOOR PLAN ABOUT)
      <br><br>
      Burton 2 is made of 8 suites, connected by hallways. Each suite contains a fully-furnished kitchen, a shared bathroom, and a unique mixture of singles/doubles/triples. All our residents share a floor lounge equipped with entertainment technology! You can find the official floor plan below.
      <br><br>
      Most suites and bathrooms on B2 are gender-neutral, unless otherwise requested. Every year, 2 of the 8 suites are reserved for residents with kosher dietary restrictions. (<a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/introduction-to-kosher-food-2122519" target="_blank">kosher dietary restrictions</a>). These 2 suites are typically single-gender.
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <strong>You are not required to purchase a meal plan if you live in BC.</strong> Some residents will still choose to purchase one; they typically find that they do not use all of their meal swipes.
      <br><br>
      All shared spaces are regularly cleaned by our wonderful housekeeping staff. BC has elevators and will be wheelchair-accessible after completion of the renovation slated for 2020-2022.
      <br><br>

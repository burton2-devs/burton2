            I’m from Boston so home was just a Red Line ride away when I was at MIT! As an alum I can definitively say that I remember the people at MIT better than the academics (no one tell my professors, please), and for that I am grateful to B2 for giving me many happy memories.

            <div id="readMore" class="p rm-mob">One of the reasons why I was able to get through stressful undergraduate times was because I always knew I had a place to go back to...B2 is a community where you can be yourself and be accepted for who you are no matter what your background is, and if you give them unconditional love you receive that back <span style="font-weight: 700;">two</span>fold. 
                <br><br>Favorite hobbies when I was living on the floor include baking chocolate chip banana bread at midnight, playing Mario Cart, belting Don’t Stop Believing during karaoke, having the best cuddle sessions, and roaming the hall to visit other suites.

            I was the GRA for Burton 2 for two years before graduating with a math PhD in 2020 
            (an interesting year -- see photo…). A couple of fun facts about me: I was 
            on my school’s diving team for a year in community college, both of my parents are 
            violinmakers, and after Burton-Conner was closed in March of 2020, I spent five months 
            on a farm in Idaho.

                As a GRA, I had a great time on Burton 2, and I would definitely 
                recommend it to new students! Feel free to send me an email if you have questions about 
                the floor that I can answer. Some of my favorite memories of B2 include: learning the 
                ins and outs of Kosher cooking (and spending quality time in the Kosher suites on Friday 
                nights!), watching Jeopardy and 60s spy shows and the World Series with students from the 
                floor, painting a collaborative mural in my apartment, feeding everyone lots of lox at 
                finals breakfasts, and all the sweet and bittersweet moments bonding with the floor in 
                the few days before we were evacuated in March of 2020 :’)

MAINTAINING THE BURTON 2 WEBSITE
********************************
These are some useful bits of information about the burton 2 website.
if you change something about the way things work, please try to keep
this file up to date so that the people that come after you can
understand what's going on.


Updating pages
===============
In order to edit pages, you will need permissions. Get someone with
burton2-www permissions to add you to the group. Once you are a part
of the group, you should be able to edit any of the files in this
directory.

All of the pages are written in HTML; there are no frameworks or
magical things happening. The most complicated page (at the time
this document was created) is the Floor Map. Instructions follow
for how to update this file.


Updating the Map
=================
To update the map, edit script.js. there are instructions for how to 
properly insert new people into the list there.

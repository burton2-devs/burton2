				<h2>Meet the GRTs</h2>
				<h3>Lisa</h3>
					<p>Lisa is a GRT for Burton 2 and a current graduate student in Mechanical Engineering.  She loves to cook (and more importantly, EAT), travel, see movies, watch Duke basketball and visit her family in Texas.  Her favorite place she's visited is Santorini, an island in Greece.  She loves school (she's in her 22nd year as a student!), but hopes that one day she'll get a real job, like most normal people.</p>
				
				<h2>Meet the Floor Chairs</h2>				
				<h3>Maya</h3>
					<p>Room: 233C</p>
					<p>Maya Hubbard is a baller from the 901 (Memphis, TN) majoring in Course 5. While ice cream is one of her personal faves, she likes to think of herself as a popsicle connoisseur. If you so happen to catch her off B2 she's probably engaged in some kind of shenanigans, at taco bell, or perhaps playing on the varsity soccer team.</p>
				<h2>Meet the Residents</h2>
				<h3>Abby</h3>
					<p>Room: 231D</p>
					<p>Abby is a sophomore from Bethesda, MD.  She is a 6-3 major, has done gymnastics since she was 5 years old (now she pole vaults!) and has been a vegetarian all her life.  She likes to travel and plans on getting MIT to pay for her travels as much as possible during her time here.</p>
				<h3>Alyssa</h3>
					<p>Room: 252B</p>
					<p>Alyssa is a senior in mathematics with computer science (18C). She is from the City (and will let you guess which one that means). She enjoys walking around cities, crocheting, 19th-century novels, and playing the recorder.</p>
				<h3>Anna</h3>
					<p>Room: 254C</p>
					<p>Anna is a junior expat from burton 3rd and a course 8 major. She's from Manoa Valley, Honolulu, Hawaii, plays varsity basketball, and keeps her room a cool 85° all year round.</p>
				<h3>Ariana</h3>
					<p>Room: 232B</p>
					<p>Ariana, a member of the class of 2013, is majoring in Course 8 and minoring in 5.  Originally from Seattle, she loves the sun and boiling summer days, and thinks that a perfect rain shower is highly underrated.  When time allows she loves exploring the city, and is fairly handy with a keen sense of direction and a high aptitude for map reading.</p>
				<h3>David</h3>
					<p>Room: 253B</p>
					<p>Hi. I am a Junior and majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico and I like to sail. I am on the sailing team here at MIT so that takes up a lot of my time. I don't cook much but I'm starting to buy more food so watch out for fire alarms. I also like hockey.</p>
				<h3>Eric</h3>
					<p>Room: 241C</p>
					<p>Eric is a junior studying Mechanical Engineering. He is from the great state of Texas (Austin to be exact) and is obsessed with sports. Outside of class he is a member of the fraternity Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE) and enjoys listening to loud music and spending time with friends.</p>
				<h3>Eryn</h3>
					<p>Room: 254B</p>
					<p>Eryn is a senior in Course 6 and as a result can rarely be seen more than 3 feet away from her computer. She's very proud of her Southern upbringing and likes to try to keep some remembrance of it in the form of food during Boston's cold winters.</p>
				<h3>Ido</h3>
					<p>Room: 251A</p>
					<p>Hi, I'm Ido (a.k.a Potter),  I am an awesome member of the class of 2014 and intend to major in course 6. I come from Israel and served in the army for 3 years. I love cooking (seriously, you should come taste!), watching TV, and I'm the guy you want to have on your team during a zombie apocalypse.</p>
				<h3>Jared</h3>
					<p>Room: 233G</p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Jared and I like long walks on the beach. Unlike almost everyone else on this floor, I don't talk in the third person all the time when writing a bio about myself.</p>
					<p>I am a junior from Newton, MA majoring in courses V and X. I am the founder of the chillzone and can commonly be found there rocking out with (at least) my shirt off or eating pasta. I am also a member of PIKE and the Varsity Cross Country and Track and Field teams when I am not injured.</p>
				<h3>Justin</h3>
					<p>Room: 233B</p>
					<p>Hi, I'm Justin, and I'm a junior studying Physics. I come from the city of Atlanta, GA (F.I.L.A.!), and prefers warmer weather to the dreadful stuff we get in Boston. I like physics, lasers, particle accelerators, Higgs bosonineutrinos, and other nonsense that normal people don't care about. I also love blasting loud music, and watching almost any sport. Oh yeah, I, like Richard, am also black. :)</p>
				<h3>Michelle</h3>
					<p>Room: 254F</p>
					<p>Michelle is a freshman intending to major in course seven, but she’s also highly intrigued by what course nine has to offer. She also feels like that is hardly the most important thing about her, and questions why she made it the first sentence of her bio. Hardcore fan of Harry Potter, LOST, Doctor Who, and Buffy, and a slightly softer core fan of Glee, Psych, Monk, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Enjoyable activities include reading, writing, running (if motivation can be mustered), intellectual conversation, and wasting time on the internet. She has often considered running away to Neverland.</p>
				<h3>Mike P.</h3>
					<p>Room: 251B</p>
					<p>Mike Pappas is a sophomore in course 8. Things about him...he likes math and science (he goes to MIT, so that's kind of a gimme), as well as running, hiking, video games, writing, and hanging out with friends doing nothing in particular. He also dislikes talking about himself and had hoped that he was done with it after the college process. No dice.</p>
				<h3>Rachel</h3>
					<p>Room: 232A</p>
					<p>Hey, I'm Rachel Bandler and I am a junior from New York majoring in chemistry and potentially course 9 too. I love to draw, paint, sketch- basically anything art! I am addicted to reading the news, and often find myself debating politics (some people will say I am *slightly* opinionated).  Come drop by suite 231 and say hi!</p>
				<h3>Ronny</h3>
					<p>Room: 233A</p>
					<p>Sup, I'm Ronny, one of the bigger fellas in B2. Besides the usual long, shirtless walks on the beach, my muscular bod glistening from the moonlight, I enjoy working out, learning about and practicing healthy nutrition, and kicking butt at DODGEBALL!!! Oh yeah, I'm from Miami and studying math.</p>
				<h3>Sharone</h3>
					<p>Room: 232C</p>
					<p>My name is Sharone Small and I am a member of the MIT Class of 2014. I hail from West Hartford, Connecticut, and I came to Cambridge hoping to major in Course 1C. I enjoy reading, playing board games, and reveling in my newfound confidence in making eggs and grilled cheese.</p>

				<h2>Former B2 Residents</h2>
				<h3>Liz</h3>
					<p>Elizabeth Maroon '10 (aka Liz the Red) used to live on Burton 2, but the Institvte commenced her and she was forced to leave.  Nowadays you can find her chasing temperature anomalies at the University of Washington (because who wants to chase something as obvious as a tornado) and generally living happily ever after.
